<h1>Cast</h1>
	
  <div class="flex-container">
    <div>
	  <p><strong>Emilio Estevez</strong> - Andrew Clark, an "Athlete" who was sentenced to Saturday detention for taping Larry Lester's butt cheeks together.</p>
      <p><strong>Paul Gleason</strong> - Vice Principal Richard Vernon, the domineering vice-principal of Shermer High School who oversees the Saturday detention. He is combative towards the students, particularly John, and judges them based on their social stereotypes.</p>
      <p><strong>Anthony Michael Hall</strong> - Brian Johnson, a "Brain" who was sentenced to Saturday detention for bringing a flare gun that was to be used in a suicide attempt. His parents’ constant forcing of him to get good grades drove him to this attempt.</p>
      <p><strong>John Kapelos</strong> - Carl Reed, a janitor at Shermer High School who appears to be on friendly terms with Brian.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p><strong>Judd Nelson</strong> - John Bender, a "Criminal" who was sentenced to Saturday detention for pulling the fire alarm and is the most argumentative towards Vernon. He has a physically and verbally abusive father who burned him on the arm with a cigar for spilling paint in the garage.</p>
      <p><strong>Molly Ringwald</strong> - Claire Standish, a "Princess" who was sentenced to Saturday detention for skipping school so that she can go shopping. Her parents, on the verge of divorce, endlessly use her to get back at each other during arguments.</p>
      <p><strong>Ally Sheedy</strong> - Allison Reynolds, a "Basket Case" who wasn't sentenced to Saturday detention and only attended as she couldn't find anything better to do. Her parents neglect her which drives her to consider running away from home.</p>
      <p><strong>Ron Dean</strong> - Mr. Clark, the father of Andrew who constantly pressures him to not “blow his ride”.</p>
